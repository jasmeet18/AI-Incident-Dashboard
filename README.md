‚ú® Design Decisions & Challenges
*Used React via CDN to keep the project lightweight and simple without needing a Node.js environment.
*Flexbox and media queries were used for responsive layout.
*State management (useState) was handled directly inside the main App component.
*A key challenge was managing React state in a single-page structure without JSX transpilation, but was solved using modern browser modules.
